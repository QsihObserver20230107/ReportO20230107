A long time ago, a man decided that he would cure all mental diseases that were a problem to his community.
Some ailments kept popping up, others were sporadic. Some people were just born dumb, but that wasn't too much of a problem.
He was very emotionally smart, so he decided to solve their issues with talk therapy, emotional emulation, and other methods.
The females of his lineage sometimes married the crazy people who were cured. This led to their children having the same problems, but to a milder extent.
Some overcame their problems and decided to become mental health doctors also. They were mentally stronger and labile.
They became monks who walked the earth meeting new clans and solving interesting psychology cases.
The clans noticed this and decided to alter the doctors legs to look more artistic, and functional.
The doctors kept walking on, doing their jobs. The females kept marrying into rich families with sons who had problems.
Sometimes the male doctor would marry into a rich family also.

This trend kept going on for thousands of years. The clans began trading with each other, building roads, and marrying each other due to the rapid success.
The ancient doctor was slowly forgotten, but loaded with mental health issues in a more systematic process. They were noted to be more ascetic in large crowds.
They hadn't become used to cities yet, or found suitable ways of communicating with others in large crowds.

Lastly, genetics was invented and every known mental health issue was recorded down to the base pair.
Competition of the genes of people in a capitalist environment became an issue, and Hitler thought he solved it in a quick manner.
He was mistaken. The tools were in place, but not the professionalism, dedication, manners, respect and enlightenment to properly handle such power.
They spread rumours about the crazy-legged-crazy-doctors, and that is where we are now.
