Many agree that your life is not your own. That is true.
However, there are those so distorted that they believe they know your place in the higher order more than Allah.
That is very funny to me. Because there are many warnings in the Quran against such things.
And so, when I walk the streets, I see a great many with no life songs of their own.
They are sung to by money, greed, lust, peer-pressure, and many other societal issues.
Over time, they are the losers. And the universe is filled with the quiet eyes of the winners.

Perhaps one day a great number of stars will appear to us.
I prey my generation finds quietness and meditation to assess the situation.
