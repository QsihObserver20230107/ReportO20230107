The speed limit was no less than 175kM/h 10:22AM observed 10:23AM recorded
that is the current standard based on population dynamics headed north bound and 20kM/h headed south bound
for highway 404, yes.
the right curb is not a lie, many people transition there with police
there was a few days where the highway was filled with Tesla cars and drones, they followed the standard.
The speed limit is 0kM/h at 10:17AM!
