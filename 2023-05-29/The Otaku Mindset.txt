Title: The Otaku Mindset
Description: Observations of Otakus made during AnimeNorth-2023.

  The otaku mindset as observed at AnimeNorth-2023 is the synthesis of a white-jew-christian and dead-christian (Elvis bloodline) fused with japanese manners. The persona of conversation is that of World-of-Warcraft players during a heated gaming session. This is in respect to how much personal information is shared, in conjunction with the volume of speech. It is a liberating method of speech, though maladapted in terms of age and manners. The upside to this speech persona is that personal information is shared with the expectation of acceptance-or-neutrality. Non-acceptance is mentally blocked in otaku and convention settings, thus the net average feeling of acceptance and liberalism. This dynamic is also reinforced by the cosplayers that permeate the social space. Given all this, the net average persona of an American Otaku is as follows:
  Persona:
    -social speech age 12 years old
    -loud or very quiet
    -socially accepting of others as a base state
    -socially awkward personally
    -able to express self in verbal format via japanese manners

The linear order of generation of the mental state of otaku culture is as follows: The Letter to the Romans (Self-made letter), Dead-Christian blood (extinguishment via Elvis), raised by world-wide-web culture in conjunction with cultural mixing and adopting japanese basic manners.

Given the linear order, this niche society is likely to crumble in the near future, yet the dynamic is likely to lead to a new planetary culture, after the death of the Baby-Boomers.
