Ave Maria
***************************************************A white pigeon flies, yet is always shunned. A white-jew burns in a lake of fire.
Oh so lawful, how so thoughtful.
A single razor blade in the automated shredder you are.
A dharmic reading without peace, a void to the orphans.
The lack of freshness, a collision of systems, a matrical crossing of fingers, chaos of minds, saturation.
May my children eat fresh yogurt and garlic, and know that from this day forward, you are Waria.
May your children suffer the full wrath of Allah for not joining mine.
May my children find peace and love in this world and the hereafter.
